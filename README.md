# Cloud-Native Digital Banking Platform on Microsoft Azure (Enterprise Architecture)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **real-world enterprise-grade digital banking platform** deployed on **Microsoft Azure** using **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, **Cosmos DB**, **Azure API Management**, **Azure Service Bus**, and **Zero Trust Security**.

It is designed to meet **Banking & Financial Services (BFSI) industry standards**, focusing on:
- ✅ High Availability
- ✅ Security & Identity Management
- ✅ Scalability and Performance
- ✅ Disaster Recovery & Multi-Region Deployment
- ✅ DevOps Automation (CI/CD Pipelines)

This project is part of my **Azure Solution Architect Portfolio**, aimed at targeting high-paying Cloud Architect roles in **Bangalore (₹4.5L+ per month)** and **Dubai (AED 30K+ per month)**.
